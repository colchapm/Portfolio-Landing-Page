    <p class="my-class">As I briefly touched on in my <a href="file:///Users/cchap14/Desktop/epicodus/portfolio-landing-page/about-me.html">about me page</a>, 
      I graduated from Indiana University with a major in Sports Marketing and Management and minors in Business and the Japanese Language. 
      For the past seven years I have been working on the Planning and Supply Chain team of an aerospace manufacturer, Precision Castparts Corporation. 
      My work experience and skillset mirrors that of an analyst. I truly enjoy the power of data - how it drives behavior and how it can impact change. While I have 
      moved on to more large-scale responsibilities at Precision Castparts, I continue to use data as the foundation of my work.

      Over the past 16 months I have become more and more disconnected with the culture and product of my company. As a result, a lot of those soul-searching questions that we often
      ask ourselves during times of uncertainty have started surfacing. This reflection has led me taking the Intro to Programming class at Epicodus. I have always been intrigued by back-end programming. 
      Although I don't understand it, I find it fascinating how it makes things work. I am hoping this class will give me more exposure to it and ultimately help me decide if programming could
      be a possible career change.
