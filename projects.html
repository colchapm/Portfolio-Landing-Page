          <li>My first project was a simple one, using HTML to tell the online world "hello". Click <a href="https://github.com/colchapm/hello-world.git">here </a>to see this project.</li>
          <br>
          <li>My next project tells you some of my favorite things using images, HTML and CSS. Learn a little bit about my family and other things I enjoy <a href="https://github.com/colchapm/my-first-webpage.git">here</a>.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I continued to get more comfortable using CSS, branching out to box models. See how my styling skills have evolved in this <a href="https://github.com/colchapm/Cupcakes.git">website</a> I created for my cupcake shop.</li>
          <br>
          <li>My most recent project used columns, classes, floats and more advanced CSS. I created a website for my favorite band, check it out <a href="https://github.com/colchapm/Glass-Animals.git">here</a> and give their <em>groovy</em> music a listen.</li>
        </ol>

        <span class="excited">I am really looking forward to polishing my HTML and CSS abilities, check back here in a few weeks to see what new tricks I've learned.</span>
