  <h2 class="supporting-header">about me</h2>
  <img src="img/self photo.jpg" class="supporting-image">
  <p class="my-class">I've never been the type of person that knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life. During my time at Indiana University, I didn't have the most direction.
    After graduating I aimlessly applied to jobs in the Midwest. While I may not have had the most clear picture of what career to pursue, there was one thing I was confident in however - I did not want to live in Indiana anymore.
    <br>
    <br>
    After much thought, I decided to pack up my Accord and move across the country to Portland, Oregon. Don't get me wrong, I had a job lined up, but it wasn't a great one. I was to be the swing-shift truck driver for 
    a company called Precision Castparts Corporation. The thought of moving 3,000 miles away to drive truck didn't give me the fuzziest of feelings, but I knew I would enjoy living in the Pacific Northwest. I knew it was a place I would grow into.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eight years later and I am happy to say I have found a home here in Portland. I can also say I am no longer a truck driver. I am now, in fact, the Planning Manager at 
    Precision Castparts. While I have grown tremendously since moving West, I <strong>still</strong> don't have the clearest picture of what to do with my life. 
    I am hoping that Epicodus will spark some direction in me.
